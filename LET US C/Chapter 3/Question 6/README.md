### PROBLEM STATEMENT

To input three points(x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3),WAP to check if three points fall on straight line.

<br>Formula used:  **Slope determined by two points shoud be equal
               <br> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)=(y3-y2)/(x3-x2)**

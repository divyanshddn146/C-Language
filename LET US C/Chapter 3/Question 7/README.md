### PROBLEM STATEMNT

To input coordinates(x,y) of center of circle and its radius and input of point(x1,y1),WAP that will determine wheter a point lies inside the circle,on the circle or outside the circle.
<br>**Hint**:if sqrt(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 ==r then point on the circle
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; sqrt(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 > r then point lies outside the circle
            sqrt(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 < r then point lies inside the circle

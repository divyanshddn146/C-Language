# FACTORIAL
In This file I have made the code on how to find factorial of a number in two ways.

In file factorial.c factorial of number is calculated using recursion method while in factorial2.c file factorial of number is calculated using simply loops.

Below is definition of Recursion:-

**Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.**

For example:
```
            #include<stdio.h>
            void main(){
                                
                                printf("This is an example of Recursion");
                                main();        
                                
                                } 
```


As when we execute this program then we will get output as:
                    This is an example of Recursion
                    This is an example of Recursion
                    This is an example of Recursion
                    This is an example of Recursion
                    This is an example of Recursion
                    
                    
And this will continue indefinetly until execution is terminated abruptly by user only.
